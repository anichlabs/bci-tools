'''
Motor-Related Cortical Potential (MRCPs) are slow negative EEG potentials observable in the 1-2 seconds before 
voluntary movement. Most clearly seen over central electrodes (Cz, C3, C4).

They are event-related potentials (ERP) and reflect brain activity in the 
supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, and primary motor cortex.

MRCP features are:
    - More robust to noise than pure motor imagery
    - Subject-independent to a degree (common morphology)
    - Time-domain based, enabling use with low-frequency hardware
    - Found in all healthy adults and most stroke patients (even if weak)

For each channel (especially Cz, C3, C4), extract:
    Feature	Method:
    - Area	Trapezoidal integration from -1.5 to 0.0 s
    - Negative peak	Minimum voltage in the window
    - Slope	Linear fit (least squares) from -1.0 to -0.5 s
        - Least Squares Method is used to derive a generalized linear equation 
          between two variables. When the value of the dependent and independent 
          variables they are represented as x and y coordinates in a 2D Cartesian 
          coordinate system. Initially, known values are marked on a plot. The plot obtained at this point is called a scatter plot.
    - Mahalanobis distance
        - The Mahalanobis distance is the distance to the centre of a class taking 
          correlation into account and is the same for all points on the same 
          probability ellipse. For equally probable classes, i.e. classes with the 
          same number of training objects, a smaller Mahalanobis distance to class 
          K than to class L, means that the probability that the object belongs to 
          class K is larger than that it belongs to L.

    Motor-Related Cortical Potential (MRCP) Feature Extraction.

    This module computes key time-domain features from EEG trials
    aligned to voluntary motor intention, based on the morphology of
    MRCPs. These slow cortical potentials (SCPs) are essential biomarkers
    in non-invasive brain-machine interfaces, particularly in pre-movement
    detection for motor rehabilitation.

    Features extracted:
        - Area under the curve (integrated negativity)
        - Negative peak amplitude
        - Slope of the negative deflection
        - (Optional) Mahalanobis distance to baseline template

    Input Assumptions:
        - EEG trials are already filtered (e.g., 0.1-1.0 Hz bandpass)
        - Trials are baseline corrected (zero-mean at rest)
        - Shape: (n_channels, n_samples)
        - Sampling frequency: typically 250 Hz.
        - Epochs are time-locked to movement onset at t=0

    Attributes:
        sfreq (float): Sampling frequency in Hz (default: 250.0)
        t (np.ndarray): Time axis in seconds (computed per trial)
        results (Dict): Stores features per channel per trial

    def extract_area(self, trial: np.ndarray) -> Dict[int, float]:
        '''
        Compute the area under the curve (AUC) of MRCP per channel.

        This method integrates the EEG signal from -1.5 to 0.0 seconds
        using the trapezoidal rule. It assumes the signal is already filtered
        and baseline corrected. The area is usually negative, reflecting the
        downward deflection of the MRCP waveform.

        Concept:
        - Instead of trying to find the exact area under a curve using calculus, the 
          trapezoidal rule approximates it by dividing the area into a series of 
          trapezoids. 
        - Each trapezoid's area is calculated using the formula: 
          (1/2) * height * (base1 + base2). 
        - The sum of these trapezoid areas provides an approximation of the total area 
          under the curve.

        -4.0 -> 0.0: is a pre-movement analysis window commonly used in MRCP studies.
        It includes:
          - The late Bereitschaftspotential (readiness potential).
          - The negative peak close to movement onset.
          - This window often contains the strongest motor-related signals.

        Compute the slope of the MRCP deflection per channel:
        MRCP deflection refers to the downward (negative) shift in EEG amplitude

        A steeper slope means stronger or faster preparation, while a flatter one 
        might suggest delayed or reduced cortical involvement.

        the window prior to movement onset (t = 0), aiding in movement-related 
        signal characterisation.

        This method fits a straight line to the EEG signal between
        -1.0 and -0.5 seconds before movement onset using the least
        squares method. The slope quantifies the rate of the negative
        build-up and is often used to assess movement preparation dynamics.
