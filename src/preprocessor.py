INTRO: SignalPreprocessor:
    - numpy is the core library for numerical operations. 
      EEG signals are often represented as NumPy arrays. 
      Think of a 2D matrix where each row is a channel and each column a timepoint.

    - scipy.signal provides signal processing tools. butter designs the 
      Butterworth filter (a type of digital filter), and sosfilt applies 
      it to your data (in a numerically stable form).

    SignalPreprocessor provides standard preprocessing operations for EEG signals,
    including filtering and normalisation.

    Methods:
        bandpass_filter() - Apply bandpass filter to a signal.
                            Removes unwanted frequencies (e.g., 
                            60 Hz power line noise or DC drift).
        z_score_normalise() - Apply Z-score normalisation.
                            Scales signals so they have zero 
                            mean and unit variance.
