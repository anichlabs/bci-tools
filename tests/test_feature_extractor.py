Scaffold:
This first test suite will:
    - Instantiate the class.
    - Input a synthetic signal: shape (4 channels x 1000 samples) (equivalent to 4s @ 250 Hz)
    - Check the output of each feature method
Include:
    - Absolute bandpower (per EEG band per channel)
    - Relative bandpower (same as above, normalised)
    - Output shape & numerical sanity checks
EEG Frequency Bands (Hz)
    - Assume standard clinical ranges:
        Band	Range (Hz)
        Delta	0.5-4
        Theta	4-8
        Alpha	8-13
        Beta	13-30
        Gamma	30-45
